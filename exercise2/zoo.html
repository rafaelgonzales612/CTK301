    <p>This image contains the picture of an animal (black panther?). This was created for Brookfield Zoo, courtsey of the Federal Art Project. It is a simple image with only the animal and the title. The title is in red to draw the eyes, in front of a parchment like background to accentuate the color. The animal overlaps with the text a little, but gives the image some depth.</p>
